    <hero><strong>You hand me the mess. I build the system.</strong></hero>

    <p>Your workload is exploding because your operations weren’t designed for the pressure you’re under. Meetings,
        tasks, requests, decisions, priorities—they’re all flowing through you. And your team is waiting for clarity
        that never fully arrives.

        What you don’t need is more advice.
        Or another framework.
        Or another “tool” promising efficiency.

        You need someone to walk in, take the operational chaos off your plate, and build the systems your organization
        has needed for years.

        That’s this service.</p>

    <h1> What I Build for You</h1>

    <p>A complete, end-to-end operational system customized to how you work.</p>

    <h2> 1. Workflow Architecture</h2>

    <p>I map your core processes, eliminate unnecessary steps, and design flows that remove friction from how your team
        executes.</p>

    <h2> 2. Automation Setup</h2>

    <p>Reduce manual effort with targeted automations that streamline requests, tracking, approvals, and recurring
        tasks.</p>

    <h2> 3. SOPs + Playbooks</h2>

    <p>Clear, concise instructions for how work gets done—no more “tribal knowledge,” no more chasing people for
        information.</p>

    <h2> 4. Leadership Dashboards</h2>

    <p>Real-time visibility into projects, priorities, and capacity so you stop managing in the dark.</p>

    <h2> 5. Team Operating Rhythms</h2>

    <p>Weekly, monthly, and quarterly rhythms so your team executes consistently without requiring constant input from
        you.</p>

    <h2> 6. Implementation Support</h2>

    <p>I work with you and your team to deploy the system, train staff, and ensure adoption sticks.</p>

    <h2> Who This Is For</h2>

    <p>Executives and leaders who:

        <li>Are drowning in meetings</li>
        <li>Are scaling without structure</li>
        <li>Can’t keep up with operational demand</li>
        <li>Are constantly reactive</li>
        <li>Don’t have the time (or desire) to build systems themselves</li>
        <li>Want a functioning operating model—not theory</li>

        <strong>If you’re losing hours every week to chaos, this is the fastest path out.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2> Timeline</h2>
    <p>Most DFY system builds are delivered in 30–90 days, depending on team size, scope, and operational
        complexity.</p>

    ---

    <h2> What You Avoid</h2>

    <p>
        <li>Months of “figuring it out”</li>
        <li>Endless meetings about processes</li>
        <li>Buying tools your team won’t actually use</li>
        <li>Trying to make off-the-shelf templates fit your environment</li>
        <li>Being the bottleneck for every decision</li>
    </p>

    ---

    <h2> What You Get Instead</h2>

    <li>A clean, documented operating system</li>
    <li>A team that knows what to do and how to do it</li>
    <li>Workflows that don’t rely on you remembering everything</li>
    <li>Automations that reduce repetitive work</li>
    <li>Clarity—without micromanagement</li>
    <li>A calmer, more predictable week</li>

    ---

    <h2> How It Works</h2>

    <p>1. Discovery Call:
        Scope the mess. Identify bottlenecks. Align on outcomes.</p>

    <p>2. Systems Audit:
        Deep dive into workflows, tooling, roles, meetings, and decisions.</p>

    <p>3. Design & Build:
        Architecture, documentation, automations, dashboards—all custom.</p>

    <p>4. Deployment:
        Rollout with your team. Training and transition support.</p>

    <p>5. Stabilize & Refine:
        Ensure the system works under real-world pressure.</p>

    <h2> Investment</h2>
