# Website Redesign Implementation Plan
Based on "CLS Website Customer Personas Advice.md"

## Executive Summary
This plan outlines the technical and structural changes required to align the Christopher Lynn Systems website with high-LTV customer personas (High-Performance Hustler, Systems-Minded Solopreneur). The focus is on increasing conversion through authority, trust signals, and clear metrics.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Trust (Immediate Impact)
**Goal:** Establish professional legitimacy and "corporate identity" to satisfy the risk-averse "Hustler" persona.

- [ ] **1. Legal Pages (Footer)**
    - *Task:* Create `privacy.html`, `terms.html`, and `disclaimer.html`.
    - *Action:* Add links to these pages in the `main-footer`.
    - *Rationale:* Use as a "litmus test" for professional legitimacy.

- [ ] **2. Trust Signals (Social Proof)**
    - *Task:* Create a "Trusted By" or "Certifications" section.
    - *Action:* Add a logo bar below the Hero section or "About" section.
    - *Content:* Use tool logos (Make.com, Zapier, Kit, Notion) if client logos are unavailable, to build technical authority.

## Phase 2: Core Conversion Architecture
**Goal:** Reduce friction and "cognitive load" for the burnt-out user.

- [ ] **3. Sticky Header with Prominent CTA**
    - *Task:* Update `main-header`.
    - *Action:* Ensure the "Book Strategy Call" or "Coaching" button is always visible, distinct from the nav links.
    - *Refinement:* Verify sticky behavior on all screen sizes.

- [ ] **4. Risk Reversal (Guarantees)**
    - *Task:* Add guarantee badges.
    - *Action:* Add "100% Satisfaction" or "Time-Back Guarantee" text/badge near the $47 Toolkit and Coaching inquiry buttons.

## Phase 3: Messaging & Narrative
**Goal:** Shift from "Problem Agitation" to "Results-Focused Metrics".

- [ ] **5. High-Authority Hero Section**
    - *Task:* Rewrite Hero copy.
    - *Action:* Change headline from "System Reset" focus to "Transformation Outcome" (e.g., "Lead at Work, Win at Home").
    - *Detail:* Add specific results (e.g., "10+ hours reclaimed").

- [ ] **6. The "Three-Step Journey"**
    - *Task:* Implement a Process Section.
    - *Action:* Create a visual 3-step breakdown (e.g., 1. Audit, 2. Automate, 3. Reclaim) replacing generic tool lists.
    - *Rationale:* Reduces cognitive load; shows a clear path to victory.

## Phase 4: Data & Optimization
- [ ] **7. Quantitative Copy Updates**
    - *Task:* Review all copy for vague promises.
    - *Action:* Replace "clarity" with numbers (e.g., "Zero unread notifications").
    - *Action:* Update testimonials to highlight specific metrics (ROI, hours saved).
